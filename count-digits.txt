Count Digits
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 30.45%Submissions: 513K+Points: 2
Given a positive integer n, count the number of digits in n that divide n evenly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). Return the total number of such digits.

A digit d of n divides n evenly if the remainder when n is divided by d is 0 (n % d == 0).
Digits of n should be checked individually. If a digit is 0, it should be ignored because division by 0 is undefined.

Examples :

Input: n = 12
Output: 2
Explanation: 1, 2 when both divide 12 leaves remainder 0.
Input: n = 2446
Output: 1
Explanation: Here among 2, 4, 6 only 2 divides 2446 evenly while 4 and 6 do not.
Input: n = 23
Output: 0
Explanation: 2 and 3, none of them divide 23 evenly.
Constraints:
1<= n <=105
