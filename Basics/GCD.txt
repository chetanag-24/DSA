Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 51.03%Submissions: 147K+Points: 1
Given two positive integers a and b, find GCD of a and b.

Note: Don't use the inbuilt gcd function

Examples:

Input: a = 20, b = 28
Output: 4
Explanation: GCD of 20 and 28 is 4
Input: a = 60, b = 36
Output: 12
Explanation: GCD of 60 and 36 is 12
Constraints:
1 â‰¤ a, b â‰¤ 109

Solution:
class Solution {
    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        // code here
        while(a!=0 && b!=0){
            if(a>b){
                a=a%b;
            }
            else{
                b=b%a;
            }
            
        }
        
        if(a!=0){return a;}
        else{ return b;}
    }
}
